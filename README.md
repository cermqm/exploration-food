Exploration Food
Selective Recipe App designed to match the needs of all diets and food restrictions. 
Great for those with allergies, religious restrictions, or are simply particular about thier food.
Will present users with an exciting new Recipe generated based on thier personalized profile!


When a user visits the site they will be presented with a form contain a search, API key input, a wide range of pre-made filters,
and the option to include or exclude any food they put into the associated inputs. 
Once they search they can save thier preferrences along with thier name.

User Story
As a person with allergies or other food restrictions, that gets bored easily with the same recipes,
I want to have easy access to new and exciting Recipes that adhere to my allergies and food prefrences,
So that I can enjoy make new dishes without worrying about how I will have to modify the recipe.
